# Aircraft Pitch Control System
### MATLAB & Simulink Based Stability and Control Analysis

This project presents a detailed stability and control analysis of an aircraft pitch dynamics system using state-space modeling, state feedback, observer design, and PID control.

---

## Project Scope
- Mathematical modeling of aircraft pitch dynamics
- Open-loop stability analysis
- Controllability and observability verification
- State feedback controller design
- Observer (Luenberger) design
- Steady-state error analysis
- PID controller implementation
- MATLAB and Simulink validation

---

## System Model
State-space representation:
ẋ = Ax + Bu  
y = Cx  

Analysis performed using eigenvalues, root locus, step response, and Routh-Hurwitz criteria.
